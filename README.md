# Federated Wiki - Forward Transfer Token

A forward transfer token is a token that propogates forward in time. Traditional crypto tokens are minted at a finite point in time, and then traded from there. Their scarcity is their defining feature. 

A forward transfer token on the other hand is meant for propogating something of significance to a community within and/or without the community. Tokens may or may not be finite, but their minting doesn't happen all at once, but rather as posessors of the token, or users of the system pass along new tokens to folks they deem worthy. 

What all of that means for a community is outside of the scope of this plugin. This plugin specifies a mechanism for the creation and permissioning of forward transferring tokens.
